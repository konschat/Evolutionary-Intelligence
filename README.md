In thid repository the Wood Optimization problem is examined using algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) and the differential evolution global and local neighborhoods(DEGL). For the same orders and stock we compare the performance of PSO and DEGL towards other optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, L-BFGS-B and SLSQP.

In order to compare the performance of the already mentioned algorithms and optimizers, metrics such as the number of fitted polygons, Iterations number(Mean, Min, Max) and Time(sec)(Mean, Min, Max) are extracted.
